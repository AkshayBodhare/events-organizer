Hi All,
Greetings from IIT Bombay Racing Team,

IIT Bombay Racing is a cross functional team with over 70 team members
from 8 departments. The team develops all-electric Formula race cars from
scratch, which participate in the prestigious Formula Student UK
competition, in July every year.

After 9 months of rigorous timelines involving conceptualizing, designing,
fabrication, assembling and testing phases, the team is finally ready with
the latest version of its all electric race car, named Orca..

We cordially invite all IITB students to witness the launch of the Car,
which is built by IITB, and will be representing IITB at the pinnacle of
world motorsport competition, FSUK

Date:Sunday, 29th May '16

Time: 4:00pm

Venue: P.C.Saxena Auditorium

The car launch event is followed by the run of the car, at KV Road. Though
we dont plan to take it to full speed, the acceleration and the sound of
an electric car will surely amaze you.

Here are some statistics of the car.

0 to 60 kmph: 1.86 seconds , 0 to 100 kmph: 3.47 seconds

Power: 108 BHP

Top speed: 145+ kmph

Hope to see you all there.

Regards

IIT Bombay Racing team
